# Anomaly Detection

#### A simple approach to find outliers in the midst of different network communications

Based on [KDDCup data](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) two approaches are taken. First with Random Forest and then with Support Vector Machine. 

For [Simplified Outlier Detection](https://github.com/sweetscientist/anomaly_detection/blob/master/anomaly_detection_pt1.ipynb) the following processes are included:
1. Load Data
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Build Model
4. Check Performance

In [Anomaly detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/sweetscientist/anomaly_detection/blob/master/anomaly_detection_pt2.ipynb) Support Vector Machine is
used, but the downside is processing time. This could be improved by parallel programming.
